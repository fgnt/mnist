# MNIST

This repo contains a mirror of the files from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ .
See that website for more details of MNIST.

The reason for this mirror is, that sometimes the download of the files get stuck for several minues.
But this only happens with `wget` and only on some computers.
With `curl` it was always possible to download the files.
